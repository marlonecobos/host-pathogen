### Description

This repository contains scripts to:

- Prepare datasets to run analyses described in the protocols presented in the manuscript. 
  - Define bases for host and pathogen niches.
  - Create virtual niches for host and pathogens considering seven distinct scenarios. 
  - Generate data using virtual niches.
  - Prepare data for further analyses.
- Run analyses described in protocols.
  - Multivariate analyses to detect niche signals.
  - Univariate analyses to detect niche signals.
- Create figures to interpret results.
  - Figures presented in the manuscript.
  - Other figures to understand the process
